            <p align="center">Pacefield Street No. 22,North District of Backlund.</p>
            <p align="center">At Loen Charity Scholarship Fund.</p>
	    <p align="center">Audrey Hall was in the director's office on the second floor.She was browsing the recent records of the foundation's external fundraising, application review, and grant distribution, as well as some reports on the current situation of the funded people.</p>
            
		
	    <p align="center">Audrey, who had already become the Seq 2 “Discerner" of the "Spectator" pathway , could completely extract the information from the sea of subconscious mind without any falsehood or concealment.But she thought sitting at the table like this and flipping through the documents page by page is undoubtedly more ceremonial and real.</p>

<p align="center">More importantly, this made her know more deeply about the changes in the fate of every student helped by the foundation.Through the names on the papers, she could see what their owners have experienced:</p>

<p align="center">A teenage girl who started business to pay gambling debts for her alcoholic father got a chance at a better education, finally became a reporter for the "Daily Observer", dedicated to reporting the suffering of people in the east district.</p>

<p align="center">A dropout teenager, whose parents were dead for some reasons returned to school instead of continuing working part-time in piers for living.He studied hard and was appreciated by the professor, so the school hired him as a respected lecturer.</p>

<p align="center">A talented poor girl no longer need to worry about the high tuition fees of the bar school.She always provided free legal aid to young students although she was so success in lawyer works now.</p>

<p align="center">These scenes flashed quickly in Audrey's clear green eyes, and she couldn't help showing a little sweet smile.</p>

<p align="center">"Compared to lofty mythical creatures, those who help ordinary people out of suffering and bring them hope in life are more worthy of the title 'angel'. Audrey, you still have a lot to do~"</p>

<p align="center">Just as she put down the scrolls in her hand, yawned a little, and was about to stand up, a figure in a black windbreaker and a top hat suddenly appeared in front of the desk. As soon as this figure appeared, it seemed that it lost all its strength and fell forward limply.</p>

<p align="center">"Mr. World!"</p>

<p align="center">Regardless of maintaining the elegance of the nobility, Audrey stepped forward quickly and helped the man up before he fell to the ground. Gehrman, who had lost consciousness, closed his eyes tightly, and leaned weakly against the arms of the girl in the white short-sleeved dress. <br>
His exposed skin was translucent, revealing the twisted and coiled ring-shaped worms beneath it. The deep and terrifying atmosphere spread, and even Audrey, who was an angel, felt the mountain-like pressure. Without words, this experienced "psychiatrist" instantly understood that Mr. "World" had reached the most dangerous edge of “losing control"!</p>

<p align="center">Audrey hugged Gehrman who was comatose tightly, and her mental body appeared directly under the spiritual sky through the subconscious sea, overlooking the spiritual world belonging to this adventurer.The blue sea which was calm before, was turbulent and fell into a tsunami-like doomsday scene right now.</p>

<p align="center">However, what shocked Miss. "Justice" was that the place that originally belonged to the "Island of Mental Body" was empty at this time, only streams of dirty mucus spewed out from the illusory dark spring, flooding the surrounding seawater.
It was as dark as ink.</p>

<p align="center">"No... the island of consciousness didn't disappear, it sank below the surface of the sea... and it's still sinking!"</p>

<p align="center">An anxious look appeared on the girl's face, "Huh...huh...Audrey, calm down! I must quickly find a way to recover Mr. World’s consciousness.</p>

<p align="center">"If this continues... His consciousness will dissolve into his subconscious, and he will never be able to wake up again! "</p>

<p align="center">"'Comfort'...'Comfort'...'Comfort'..." The "Psychoanalysis" at the angelic level was released again and again, and the violent sea of mind gradually returned to calm under the comfort of the power which like a gentle breeze.</p>

<p align="center">However, no matter how hard she tried, the sinking speed of Mr. World’s consciousness island did not slow down at all.</p>

<p align="center">"What on earth...what should i do?" Time passed cruelly, and the more urgent pressure made the experienced Audrey show a trace of despair, "I must find out what happened to Mr. World to become like this... ...But I can't see anything even if I use "Discern"... Huh? What's going on here?!"</p>

<p align="center">Just as she was observing, the sink of the "Island of Mental Body" under the sea surface suddenly lagged for a moment.</p>

<p align="center">Without a doubt, as an "Spectator", Audrey was sure that this was definitely not caused by her ability, "Placate"!</p>

<p align="center">"That is to say, maybe what happened in the real world is reflected in the spiritual world, and bringing a brief recovery for Mr. World ! "</p>

<p align="center">A "virtual personality" was separated to continue to "placate" Gehrman's spiritual ocean, and Audrey's consciousness left decisively and returned to herself.</p>

<p align="center">In an instant, she found that Mister "World"'s face had been completely buried in her gully at some point. The dry lips were sticking to the white and tender breasts, and his slight breath made her itch.</p>

<p align="center">A blush crept up the girl's cheeks. The noble lady, who had never had such an intimate encounter with a man, subconsciously wanted to push Gehrman away, but she suddenly stopped as if realizing something.</p>

<p align="center">"The black viscous liquid symbolized pure desire, the calm sea of mind was eroded by desire and has no outlet, so it fell into endless frenzy. If this is true, Mr. "World" possibly let his island of consciousness sink continuously intentionally ! As long as the desire for riots does not control his mind, he will only fall into a deep sleep, instead of falling into madness, and will not cause harm and destruction to the outside world..."</p>

<p align="center">Bit her lips lightly, Audrey's eyes lighted up.</p>

<p align="center">"The reason why his consciousness stopped sinking before was because he felt that his desire had been relieved a little, and the instinct of survival suppressed the tendency of self-destruction. Then... touching my... my breasts is Mr. world’s part of desire?”</p>

<p align="center">For some reason, a sense of joy and faint pride rose in Audrey's heart as if her appearance was recognized by her sweetheart. She seemed had made up her mind, the girl took the adventurer's slightly illusory hand and pressed it tightly on her busty breasts.</p>

     <p align="center">"Sure enough~ the situation in the "Island of Mental Body" has improved again! Audrey, you are so smart~"</p>

     <p align="center">The blond girl showed a bright smile, clenched her right fist, and waved it lightly in the air, "Next... ahhhh! Are you really going to do such a shameful thing... But if it's Mr. World..."</p>
